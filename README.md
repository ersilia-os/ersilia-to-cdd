# Ersilia to CDD Vault
Ersilia Adaptor for making uploads to CDD vault for experimental results

This repository is under construction. The goal is to use the CDD vault API to easily upload Ersilia outputs into CDD for quick visualization and chemical exploration.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Given a CSV file generated by Ersilia, containing key, input, and output columns, upload it to the CDD vault.
- [ ] Develop a command (for example, `ersilia2cdd -f $ERSILIA_OUTPUT_CSV` to quickly perform this operation using the CDD vault API.
